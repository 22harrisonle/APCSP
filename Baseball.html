    <h1>Baseball</h1>
    <img src = "WACCPACK.jpg">
    <p class="p"> In my senior year of High School I decided to play baseball. I had not played baseball at a competitive level since 5th grade, so getting back into my rythm was difficult. I finished the year batting .230 with 3 hits, one of them being a double, and 3 RBIs.  </p>
